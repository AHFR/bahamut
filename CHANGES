Changes for 1.4.23
- Some error message changes/fixes
- Fixed a cloaking bug
- Added support to source from a different local IP address when /connecting
  out to another server; useful for servers which don't want to use the main
  IP in the M: line as the server<->server IP
  - To use: Add :<local IP> to the end of a C: line
  - E.g.: C:192.168.0.1:pass:server.dal.net:7325:10:192.168.10.200
- Block DCCs of .htm/.html files due to script viruses being spread in this
  way
- Prompt for max channels per user and oper pw encryption in the config
  script
- Example.conf brought up to date
- Disabled ident on server<->server connections, to deal with "sux mode,"
  which happens when the ident port is filtered and the connection has to
  time out; this is done by delaying the ident lookup until USER is
  received from a client

Changes for 1.4.22
- Fixed a bug where a server with a bad name trying to connect or trying
  to be used in /links could crash Bahamut
