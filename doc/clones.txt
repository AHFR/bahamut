Clone Limiting
==============
Bahamut supports limiting the number of connections from a single place,
and this file describes the configuration for that feature.  There are two
kinds of places: a "host" is a single IP (10.0.0.1); a "site" is a single
/24 block of IPs (10.0.0.*).  Clones are the number of connections from a
given place.

Two types of clone limits are supported: local clones are the number of
connections from a place on this server only; global clones refer to
connections on the entire network.  When a clone limit is reached, the
server denies further connections from that place.


Local clone limiting
--------------------
The default local clone limits are set using the local_clones token in the
Options block in ircd.conf; see doc/reference.conf for details.  In the
absence of more specific limits, the defaults will regulate all connections
to the server.

Local limits set using the maxclones token in a Class block override the
defaults; this is typically used with Allow blocks to provide exemptions
for specific hosts.

Example:

        options { local_clones 1:3; };
        class { name special; maxclones 5; };
        allow { host *@10.0.0.2; class special; };

    Suppose there is one client connected from 10.0.0.3.  If another client
    from 10.0.0.3 tries to connect, it will be rejected because the default
    limit of 1 connection per host was reached.  Two clients from 10.0.0.2
    will be allowed to connect, because the "special" class allows up to 5
    connections from a single host.  However, a third client from 10.0.0.2
    will not be allowed to connect, because the class did not specify a
    site limit.  The default of 3 clients per site (10.0.0.*) applies in
    this case, even though the class would have allowed more clones from
    that host (10.0.0.2).

The default limits can be changed online using the SET DEFLCLONES command.
Note that this setting is not saved and will be lost when the server is
restarted; it is useful for testing or setting temporary limits.

    SET DEFLCLONES                            - to display both limits
    SET DEFLCLONES <host limit>               - to set the host limit
    SET DEFLCLONES <host limit>:<site limit>  - to set both limits

    Supplying a limit of 0 will revert to the internal default.

Specific local limits can be set online using the SET LCLONES command; this
is called the "soft" local limit and overrides all other local limits.
Like DEFLCLONES, this setting is temporary.

    SET LCLONES <host/site>                   - to display the limit
    SET LCLONES <host/site> <limit>           - to set the limit

    Use a specific host or site mask, e.g. "10.0.0.1".  Supplying a limit
    of 0 will remove the soft limit; class and default limits will be used
    instead.

Going back to the example above, a third client from 10.0.0.2 could be
allowed to connect by either changing the default local limits, or by
setting a soft local limit for the site.  Both could be done online:

    /quote set deflclones 1:4
    /quote set 10.0.0.* 4

Of course, the settings in ircd.conf could also be corrected appropriately.

Note that it is possible to create some interesting configurations using
the class setting.  For example, this would effectively allow 5 clones from
a specific ident@host, since only clients matching the allow block would get
the increased per-host limit:

    options { local_clones 1; };
    class { name special; maxclones 5; };
    allow { host ident@host; class special; };


Global clone limiting
---------------------
This works in basically the same way as local clone limiting, except that
it considers connections on the entire network, and is intended to be
managed by network services.

The default global clone limits are set using the global_clones token in
the Options block in ircd.conf; see doc/reference.conf for details.  In the
absence of more specific limits, the defaults will regulate all connections
to the server.  Note that to be effective, all servers must share the same
global limits.  A server can only reject new connections to itself; it
cannot tell other servers to do so.

Network services can set specific limits using the SVSCLONE command; these
are referred to as "hard" global clone limits.  The command syntax is
provided for services authors to reference; it is not accessible to
clients.

    SVSCLONE <host/site> <limit>              - to set the limit

    Use a specific host or site mask, e.g. "10.0.0.*".  Supplying a limit
    of 0 will remove the hard limit.  This setting is stored by all servers
    and propagated on netburst, in a manner similar to SQLINES.

The default limits can be changed online using the SET DEFGCLONES command.
Note that this setting is not saved and will be lost when the server is
restarted; it is useful for testing or setting temporary limits.

    SET DEFLGLONES                            - to display both limits
    SET DEFLGLONES <host limit>               - to set the host limit
    SET DEFLGLONES <host limit>:<site limit>  - to set the both limits

    Supplying a limit of 0 will revert to the internal default.

Specific global limits can be set online using the SET GCLONES command;
this is called the "soft" global clone limit and overrides the defaults.
It will also override a services-set hard limit if it is lower; it is not
possible to set a soft limit higher than a hard one.  Like DEFGCLONES,
this setting is temporary.

    SET GCLONES <host/site>                   - to display the limits
    SET GCLONES <host/site> <limit>           - to set the soft limit

    Use a specific host or site mask, e.g. "10.0.0.1".  Supplying a limit
    of 0 will remove the soft limit; hard and default limits will be used
    instead.


Monitoring
----------
Rejection notices for clone connections are sent to usermode +j, in the following format:

    clone <nick!user@host> (<place> <online>/<limit> <type> <from>)

    <nick!user@host> is the rejected client
    <place> is the host or site mask, e.g. "10.0.0.*"
    <online> is the number of clients currently online from that place
    <limit> is the limit for that place
    <type> is "local" or "global"
    <from> is where the limit was set:
           "default", "soft", "hard", "class <name>"

General statistics about the clones system is available on STATS d.

A list of specific limits is available on STATS D, returned on numeric 225:

    D <host/site> <soft local limit> <soft global> <hard global>


Notes
-----
When local and global limits differ, the lowest limit applies.  This means
you should carefully choose the defaults and how you want to manage the
specific limits, as working with both types of limits at once can be
difficult.

When a client is rejected, its exit reason is one of:

    Too many connections from your host
    Too many connections from your site

It is not told which specific limit was reached.

Very little host/site mask validation is done for the online commands; it
is possible to query and set limits for completely bogus masks.  Such
limits will be retained but never used.
