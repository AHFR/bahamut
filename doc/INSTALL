HOW TO BUILD:
------------- 
1.  Run the configure script.  It will setup include/setup.h and the
Makefiles to match your system:
	./configure

2.  Run the config script. It will allow you to set up certain options
which are compiled into the ircd. This is an automated way of changing
the most common settings used in include/config.h. It will create a file,
include/options.h, which you can save for use with other bahamut releases.
	./config

3.  [OPTIONAL] Edit the the "include/config.h" file.  This allows you to 
change various options of how the ircd will operate. Usually the defaults
are OK.

4.  "make" should build ircd.

5.  "make install" will work if you properly specified paths in step 2.

Best of luck!

If you re-run configure, you must always rerun config. Before rebuilding the
ircd after this, always remember to do a "make clean."
