- increase WATCH/DCCALLOW limits for opers (don't forget 005)
- unified nick/user/host scrubbing, fix channel ban masks
- fix numeric 338 colon placement
- scale svsheld expiry times based on change attempts
- sort out WATCH timestamps
- m_server, verify remote IP before doing exists checks

- make leaves not autoconnect if already linked to something
- consider rwho callout to match ident slices
- fix forbidden nick notice format, consider other notices
- increase +I mask limit
