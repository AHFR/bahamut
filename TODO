THINGS TO FIX BEFORE RELEASE
----------------------------
   
    - Memory counting 
    - Fix /kline and /unkline routines to operate happily with the 
      new conf parser.
    - Fix our broken-ass conf structure handling such that we check
      on the existence of pointers before attempting to use them.
      Then remove unnessecary one byte mallocs.  Disgusting kludge.
    - Clean up config.h [Half done]
    - Fix make install
